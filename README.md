# NimHack
A fun project with the objective of copying Nethack in Nim

I'll be using this project as a way to learn more about game programming and to have some fun as well. I've always enjoyed Nethack type of games, which is why I chose to start this project.

**Controls:**  
```
  ◤  ▲  ◥  
    7 8 9  
  ◄ 4   6 ►  
    1 2 3  
  ◣  ▼  ◢  
  
  Q: quit  
 ```
**Future updates:**  
-Enemies and combat (With magic and all)  
-Hopefully remove the screen flickering completely  
-A backpack and an assortment of items  
-Other fun features that I'll add in the future once I finish those above
